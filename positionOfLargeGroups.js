// In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.
// For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".
// Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.
// The final answer should be in lexicographic order.
