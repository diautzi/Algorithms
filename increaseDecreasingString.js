// Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:
//
// Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
// Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
// Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
// Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
// Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
// Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
// Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
// In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.
//
// Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
// Output: "abccbaabccba"
// Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
// After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
// First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
// After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
// After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"
