// We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
// Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
// If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
// If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
// At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
